    <h2>QA Manager & Quality Architect</h2>

    <p class="tagline">
      I build modern QA systems that connect testing, automation, data and AI to reduce risk and increase delivery speed.

      <h3>What I do</h3>
      <p>
        I lead QA teams and design end-to-end quality systems for large ecommerce platforms.
        My focus is not just testing, but connecting <strong>automation, Jira, data and AI</strong>
        to give teams full visibility, faster feedback and less manual work.
      </p>
      <p>
        I currently work in the Inditex ecosystem (via Viewnext), managing legacy and modern QA setups,
        while building internal tools with Retool, Power BI, APIs and AI to monitor quality, production issues
        and team performance.
